### Why must we choose you?
I was not aware of coding until I took CS in my Higher Secondary, after that I just loved doing it and that is the sole reason why I thought of choosing Computer Science for
my higher education.I think that this club can broaden my understanding about the subject and I am pretty sure that this club needs hardworking people like me.
### What is your plan for the next 6 months?
In 6 months I see myself doing progressive improvement in competative coding problems with the club and to learn Flutter so that I can make really cool apps. I also see myself
doing great in academics as it is also equally important. 
### How would you contribute back to the club?
I will try my best to do things which the club want from me and also try to achieve something with the club.
### Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
I personally think its the best way to help one who attempt the test to learn, a wide variety of things within a month. It maybe difficult at the start but the opportunity to clear
the doubts with the seniors makes it easy.
