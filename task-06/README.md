My first flutter app. I have used native android previously, but this was a new experience. I was so motivated to learn this, hope I can learn more about flutter.
Task objective was simple and direct, that helped me.First I just learn basics of Dart and found that it is very similar to c. With the help of google and youtube I successfully completed the task
